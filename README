This is the start of my first django blog app.

The index page displays all published posts from the DB.

The Post page displays specific blog post by ID

The user_home page displays all posts, published and not published, from the current user.


So far this app has basic Admin CRUD, the create/read portion of CRUD for regular users, basic CSS and JavaScript to handle forms and displays....



Much more to come :)
