This is the start of my first django blog app.

The index page displays all published posts from the DB.

The Post page displays specific blog post by ID from the database

The user_home page displays all posts, published and not published, from the current user. From here, the user can create, read, update and delete their posts.


So far this app has basic Admin and User CRUD, basic CSS and JavaScript to handle forms and displays....



Much more to come :)
